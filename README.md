Ising Model
=======
Object oriented implementation of the Ising model - has a graphical output (for 1D and 2D, made with Processing).
Data Output far from complete.

Also 3D not debugged.

Swendsen Wang implementation still pretty bad.
StackOverflow in the cluster- finding method with more than 20k lattice sites (recursive dfs).
