Ising Model
=======
Ising model - has a graphical output (for 1D and 2D, made with Processing).
Data Output not very sophisticated.

Also 3D not well tested.

Swendsen Wang implementation still pretty bad.
StackOverflowException in the cluster- finding method with more than 20k lattice sites (due to recursive instead of iterative dfs)
